Revision history for Perl extension Date::PeriodParser.

0.02  Sat Jun  1 10:14:50 BST 2002
    - Fix dependencies.
    - Replace tests with more extensive Test::More-based tests.
    - fix 'night' to be a non-overlapping period with 'morning'
      (is now 21:00:00 to 05:59:59 the next day).
    - better support for odd but acceptable wording ("the day
      before tomorrow", etc.).
    - support for "in the" (particularly, support for "in the
      morning/afternoon" meaning "tomorrow morning/afternoon" 
      if it's not currently morning).
