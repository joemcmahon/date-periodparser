        - 09vague.t bug finally found: caused by different starts of daylight
          savings. Luckily (or unluckily) the date chosen crosses the DST
          boundary in CEST (Central Europe Summer Time) but not in any 
          US time zone (code has previously been run in EDT/PDT and EST/PST).
          A huge thank-you to the CPAN Testers who exposed this bug.
          If the computed range around the time crosses the daylight savings
          time boundary *in the current timezone*, we have to adjust the 
          resulting time either forward or back an hour to get a consistent
          result in every timezone.
        - Added a test to run the problematic vague test in a lot of different 
          timezones, both north and south of the equator, including some
          of the odd ones, like Phoenix AZ, and Indiana.
        - Added POSIX to the prereqs, since we need it for the timezone tests.

        - Still some reports of vague.t failing by an hour; suspect remaining
          DST-related errors. Added diags to show the timezone and whether the
          machine running the tests thinks the time is daylight savings or not.

	- Integrated most excellent patch from Doug Fischer, fixing a problem in
	  vague and  recent times related to different interpretations of 
          epoch-seconds in different timezones (which is why I could never 
          duplicate the error ...)

      before tomorrow", etc.).
