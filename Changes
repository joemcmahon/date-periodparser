Revision history for Perl extension Date::PeriodParser.
0.17  Sat Jan 26 01:27:56 PST 2013
    - Formerly, you could only do date offsets in days. You can now do
      them in days, months, weeks, and years, and they no longer mess up
      when going over a month or year boundary (thanks to Mark Adler from
      Nokia for sending me a patch, which I proceeded to distort out of
      recognizability to add the week/month/year offsets).
    - Updated the docs so we all know what works now.
    - Somehow managed to badly hash up the Changelog; now fixed.
    - I spelled Mark's name wrong (d'oh!).
    - There was a bug in _zyprexa() for dates rolling forward over a
      month boundary. Fixed.

0.16  Fri Jan 25 22:15:27 PST 2013
    - Realized that _zyprexa (the sub that makes dates sane) now makes
      week, month and year ranges (like day ranges) easy to add, so now 
      ranges like 'six weeks ago' and 'in two weeks' work as well.

0.15  Fri Jan 25 21:47:11 PST 2013
    - Fixed year-end and month-end rollovers from 'xxx days ago'
      (thank you to Mark Adler at Nokia for the original patch, which
      I twisted into a horrible parody of itself in the name of
      generalizing it)

    - Still problems with some time zone or another in CEST timezone.
      Added a little more debugging for this situation in timezone test.
    - Spelling fix in Changes.

    - Neglected to update changelog; no actual code changes in this release

0.12  Mon Jul 11 12:44:19 PDT 2011
    - fixed timezone test to skip on Windows (tzset doesn't work there)
    - dropped use vars in two tests that were throwing errors on 5.6

        - 09vague.t bug finally found: caused by different starts of daylight
          savings. Luckily (or unluckily) the date chosen crosses the DST
          boundary in CEST (Central Europe Summer Time) but not in any 
          US time zone (code has previously been run in EDT/PDT and EST/PST).
          A huge thank-you to the CPAN Testers who exposed this bug.
          If the computed range around the time crosses the daylight savings
          time boundary *in the current timezone*, we have to adjust the 
          resulting time either forward or back an hour to get a consistent
          result in every timezone.
        - Added a test to run the problematic vague test in a lot of different 
          timezones, both north and south of the equator, including some
          of the odd ones, like Phoenix AZ, and Indiana.
        - Added POSIX to the prereqs, since we need it for the timezone tests.

        - Still some reports of vague.t failing by an hour; suspect remaining
          DST-related errors. Added diags to show the timezone and whether the
          machine running the tests thinks the time is daylight savings or not.

	- Integrated most excellent patch from Doug Fischer, fixing a problem in
	  vague and  recent times related to different interpretations of 
          epoch-seconds in different timezones (which is why I could never 
          duplicate the error ...)

    - Replace tests with more extensive Test::More-based tests.

	- Added global Test::More-compatible debugging.

      before tomorrow", etc.).
